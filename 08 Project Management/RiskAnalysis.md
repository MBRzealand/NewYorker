# Risk Analysis

    We allocated approximately 8 hours of work daily not including weekends for 20 days, 
    which results in 160 hours per student, or 640 total for our group.

|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Counter Strategy | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence | Revised Priority |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------| --------------------------------------------------------- |--------- | -------- | --- |
| Lack of Overview | 60% | Consequence can vary in severity depending on length of lack of overview, however always leads to worse report and/or application <br><br> (160/640)| 96 | Daily meeting with recap and planning for next day. | 20% | Better overview which results in less severe consequences and better chance of catching mistakes early on, reverting before faulty implementation. <br><br> (14/640) | 2.8 |
| Unable to deliver partially complete app due to priorities | 30% | Unable to live up to client expectations <br><br> (320/640) | 96 | Allocating extra time the final week as well as being available the last weekend before turn-in | 20% | Adding more time but less personal time <br><br> (0/640) | 0 |
| Unable to complete thorough report in time | 10% | Unable to live up to exam requirements <br><br> (640/640) | 64 | Allocating sufficient time to write the report. | 10% | Able to deliver report <br><br> (300/640) | 30 |
| Teachers unable to provide guidance in a timely manner | 30% | The report not reaching full potential, potential for project derailing <br><br> (96/640) | 28.8 | Working peer to peer to resolve issues across groups, as well as potentially contacting mentors. | 10% | Even if the project ends up derailing, the problem will be reflected in every group <br><br>(14/640) | 1.4 |
| Equipment malfunctions during project | 40% | Potential data loss or delay/loss in workforce <br><br> (8/640) | 3.2 | Frequent commits and pushes to branches, frequent back-ups, report in cloud, back-up equipment is prepared beforehand (potential spare laptop). | 20% | Data loss and delays minimized <br><br> (0/640) | 0 |
| Misinterpreted Dimensions for diagram | 20% | Fitting and pricing system would be unprecise, customer wouldnt be able to make use of the application <br><br> (0/640)| 0 | No countermeassure because of no significant consequence | 0% | No revised consequence because of no countermeassure | no revised priority because of no revised consequence |
| Cannot communicate with client| 10% | No feedback available, developed application might not meet client expectations <br><br> (0/640) | 0 | No countermeassure because of no significant consequence | 0% | No revised consequence because of no countermeassure | no revised priority because of no revised consequence |
