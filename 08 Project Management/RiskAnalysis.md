# Risk Analysis

We use the following metric to illustrate severity for consequences:

    1-2  : very low  
    3-4  : low  
    5-6  : medium  
    7-8  : high  
    9-10 : very high  


|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Counter Strategy | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence | Revised Priority |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------| --------------------------------------------------------- |--------- | -------- | --- |
| Lack of Overview | 60% | Consequence can vary in severity depending on length of lack of overview, however always leads to worse report and/or application <br><br> (7/10)| 4.2 | Daily meeting with recap and planning for next day. | 20% | Better overview which results in less severe consequences and better chance of catching mistakes early on, reverting before faulty implementation. <br><br> (4/10) | 0.8 |
| Unable to complete report in time | 30% | Unable to live up to exam requirements <br><br> (10/10) | 3 | Allocating more time to write the report, which in turn would allow more time for writing the report. | 10% | Able to deliver report <br><br> (3/10) | 0.3 |
| Teachers unable to provide guidance | 30% | The report not reaching full potential, potential for project derailing <br><br> (7/10) | 2.1 | Working peer to peer to resolve issues across groups, as well as potentially contacting mentors. | 10% | Even if the project ends up derailing, the problem will be reflected in every group <br><br>(6/10) | 0.6 |
| Equipment malfunctions during project | 40% | Potential data loss or delay/loss in workforce <br><br> (5/10) | 2 | Frequent commits, frequent back-ups, report in cloud, back-up equipment is prepared beforehand (potential spare laptop). | 20% | Data loss and delays minimized <br><br> (2/10) | 0.4 |
| Unable to deliver complete app due to priorities | 30% | Unable to live up to client expectations <br><br> (6/10) | 1.8 | Allocating less time to write the report would allow us more time for app development, which in turn would make us able to deliver a more functional app. | 20% | Less complete report <br><br> (9/10) | 1.8 |
| Misinterpreted Dimensions for diagram | 20% | Fitting and pricing system would be unprecise, customer wouldnt be able to make use of the application <br><br> (4/10)| 0.8 | Thorough code reviewing of the functions that make use of the dimensions, so we have the highest probability of catching potential mistakes. | 10% | Reduces chances of severe mistakes in the most essential part of the app <br><br> (1/10)| 0.1 |
| Cannot communicate with client | 10% | No feedback available, developed application might not meet client expectations <br><br> (5/10) | 0.5 | Ensure scheduled customer meetings are utilized, communicate with teachers to ensure enough time with client. | 10% | Lessen amount of wasted worktime on unwanted/unneeded features in application <br><br> (1/10)| 0.1 |
