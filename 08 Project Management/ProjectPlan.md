# Project Plan 
The project plan covers the first year project running from 17/05-2021 9.00 AM to 11/06-2021 12.00 AM
The project is built upon the rational unified process iteration plan.
<br> 
### Inception phase
In the first iteration running from 17/05 to the 23/05  in the inception phase we have so far. 
- Done a risk analysis and assement. 
- Outlined the project.
- Created the Use case diagram. 
- Set up the project structure. 
- Set up the conventions.
- Created the Readme. 
<br> 

In the last half of the iteration we will. 
- Create breif use cases for the first 2 use cases. 
- Create Mock-ups to show in firday the  21/05. 
- Create our Company mandate vision document. 
<br>

We will start on the elaboration phase the 24/05/2021. This phase will be done 11/06/2021 
We are planning to have 3 iterations in the elaboration phase, so we can remove all risks from our project. <br>
The last to phases (construction and transition) will both be taking place from the 11/06/2021 until the 17/06/2021.


### Elaboration phase  
#### Iteration 1  
The first iteration of the elaboration phase or the second overall iteration runs from 24/05/2021 to 30/05/2021.
In this iteration we plan to make the casual and fully dressed UC and the artifacts pertaining to it, only for the main scenario and not include extra features. After the artifacts we plan to implement the most essential features to create and test a program, which will become a prototype which we could show and test in the meeting planned on 28/05/2021 for feedback.  
List of the stuff to be done in this iteration.  
- UC (Casual and fUlly dressed)
- DOM.
- SSD.
- AD.
- OCs.
- SDs.
- DCD.
- Implement essential features.
- System test.

#### Iteration 2  
The second iteration of the elaboration phase or the third overall iteration runs from 31/05/2021 to 06/06/2021.
In this iteration we plan to make the exceptions checks and customize feature which will require us to update a lot of our artefacts. The SSD, DOM, AD, OCs, SDs, DCD are all updated and new OCs and SDs are created. Besides exceptions and customize feature, we also plan to create the wall drawing feature and database for the stores. All this will create our second prototype. After creating the second prototype we also plan to test it with unit- and system test it including code-coverage plus test it in the meeting planned on 04/06/2021 for feedback.  
List of the stuff to be done in this iteration.  
- UML artefacts.
- Exceptions check.
- Customize feature.
- Wall drawing feature.
- Unit test
- System test.
