# Procedure for creating issues


## Naming

Start "Big" not "small" when naming the issue.

If the issue is about creating an artifact or feature then use "Create" as the first word.

If the artifact or feature exists already then use "Update" as the first word.

Give the issue a description if the title alone is not enough to describe what the issue is about and/or if the title is easy to misunderstand.

## Creating

*Here you will find a guide on how to create issues for projects (iterations), and how you can connect them to pull requests. There is a short text and a step by step guide which is longer.*


### Short


To create an issue fast then go into "Issues" and create a new issue, though you have to remember to choose what project it should be placed on and what milestone it is to be connected to, or you can go into the project and create a new note and then convert it into an issue.

### Guide


#### There exists two methods for creating Issues


1. **Add issue through Projects**


- Firstly click on projects and choose the project you want to make an issue on.


- Under the column "To do" click on the little plus symbol(+) so you can add a note.


- Give the note a short describtive title on the issue and click “Add”.


- After you have added the note then click on the three small dots(“...”) in the cornrr of the note, and then click “Convert to issue”.


- After that then you can click on the title and it will open on the right side.


  - If you click on the title on the right side then it will a new tab for the issue, where you can then choose which milestone it should be connected to, and such.

###### Extra


- If you want to add Assignees to an issue then you can one (Privat) or more (Open) Assignees on the right side.
  - If your repo is “Privat” then you can only assign one assignee, but if it is “Open” then you can add up to 10 assignees.
