# Risk Analysis

We use the following metric to illustrate severity:

    1-2  : very low  
    3-4  : low  
    5-6  : medium  
    7-8  : high  
    9-10 : very high  


|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Unable to deliver complete app due to priorities | 3 | Unable to live up to client expectations | 5 | 2 | Unable to deliver report |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Allocating less time to write the report would allow us more time for app development, which in turn would make us able to deliver a more functional app.



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Misinterpreted Dimensions for diagram | 2 | fitting and pricing system would be unprecise, customer wouldnt be able to make use of the application | 8 | 1 | reduces chances of severe mistakes in the most essential part of the app |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Thorough code reviewing of the functions that make use of the dimensions, so we have the highest probability of catching potential mistakes. 



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Cannot communicate with client | 1 | No feedback available, developed application might not meet client expectations | 7 | 1 | Lessen amount of wasted worktime on unwanted/unneeded features in application |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Ensure scheduled customer meetings are utilized, communicate with teachers to ensure enough time with client.



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Unable to complete report in time | 3 | Unable to live up to exam requirements | 10 | 1 | Unable to deliver report |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Allocating more time to write the report, which in turn would allow more time for writing the report.



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Teachers unable to provide guidance | 3 | The report not reaching full potential, potential for project derailing | 6 | 1 | Even if the project ends up derailing, the problem will be reflected in every group |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Working peer to peer to resolve issues across groups, as well as potentially contacting mentors.



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Equipment malfunctions during project | 4 | Potential data loss or delay/loss in workforce | 2 | 2 | Data loss and delays minimized |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Frequent commits, frequent back-ups, report in cloud, back-up equipment is prepared beforehand (potential spare laptop).



|  Risk | Probability | Consequence | Priority | Revised Probability | Revised Consequence |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |--------- |
| Lack of Overview | 6 | Consequence can vary in severity depending on length of lack of overview, however always leads to worse report and/or application | 8 | 2 | Better overview which results in less severe consequences and better chance of catching mistakes early on, reverting before faulty implementation. |

**Counter Strategy:**  
Daily meeting with recap and planning for next day.
