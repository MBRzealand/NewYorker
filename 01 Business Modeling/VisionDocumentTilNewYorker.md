Byens Vinduer offers a rustic and recognisable design as seen in old industrial
building deisgn from the New York area, these walls made from wrought iron og slide in glass
can and are made to fit the customers home as roomdividers, walls and the latter with
options for passage giving a clean and solid look to your home.

The design came about as many of these industrial building were adapted into
apartments and came to be know as "lofts", which is large open rooms
consisting of one large room with sectioned by these special walls
matching the design of the building windows.

This rustic design incidentially also matches very well with the
minimalistic room of Scandinavian home design.

The people behind Byens vinduer, have in their time run into mass produced
immitation which didn't live up to the stylistic standard that they appreciate,
and aim to create walls made for the individual customers home, delivering
the well know wrought iron and glass tiles look that they so apreciate for
the customers rooms, garden or shower.
