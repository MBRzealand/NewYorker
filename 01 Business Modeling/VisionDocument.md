# Vision

The vision for our new NY-Builder system is to simplify the process, so it will be easy and fast for the consultant to get an overview of the potential cost of a New Yorker wall.
The program will have a raw and rustic feel/design which will make it simple for the consultants to use. This in turn can help the consultant to easily create a wall and show its potential price to the customer and send an order.
